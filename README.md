# A guide to installing Ubuntu 18.04:

There are two options:

1. Install as a virtual machine
2. Install as an OS alongside Windows


# First option (easier but limited and slower to run at times):

1. Download Oracle VM VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Install it accordingly.
3. Once you've opened the program after installation create a new machine by clicking on New.
