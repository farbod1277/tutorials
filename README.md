# A guide to installing Ubuntu 18.04:

There are two options:

1. Install as a virtual machine
2. Install as an OS alongside Windows


# First option: VM (easier but limited and slower to run at times):

1. Download Oracle VM VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Install it accordingly.
3. Once you've opened the program after installation create a new machine by clicking on New.

4. Choose Ubuntu for your virtual machine's OS.

5. Allocate as much RAM possible (in the green area) for best performance of the VM.

6. Create a virtual hard disk.

9. Choose the size as large as you can have on your system (30GB should be enough).

10. After creating the machine double click on it to start it.

11. You need to download ubuntu 18.04 iso disk file from [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.1/)

12. Select the file you just downloaded for the VM to boot from.

15. Continue with default selections until the installation is complete.

All done.

# Second option: Dual Boot (a bit harder to do depending on your system but runs much better and is not limited like the VM.)

Note that I've done this on a Surface Pro 2017 with Windows 10 installed, it might be a little different depending on your system.

1. Make sure you have enough space on your device for Ubuntu to be installed (at the very least 10GB, but 30GB and above is preffered)

2.
